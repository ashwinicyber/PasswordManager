What is a Password Manager?
 
It is a software that allows users to generate, store and manage credentials for both local services and online services.
It helps in the creation and retrieval of strong credentials, as well as their storage in an encrypted database or their calculation on software packages that can be installed remotely. Knowing what is a password manager is, why it is useful, and how it works helps users to install the tool as quickly as possible.
 
 
How does it work?
The password manager that is installed remotely, also known as desktop-based or offline manager, encrypts and stores credentials on a single machine or device, such as your laptop or smartphone. Your information is saved in an encrypted file to which you can get entrance using your master passphrase.
 
 
Are they safe to use?
They are extremely safe to use when it comes to storing your data. Many of the more popular ones employ “zero-expertise” encryption, which prohibits the software’s provider from accessing your data, regardless of whether it is saved within the tool itself.
A number of services employ army-grade AES 256- encryption to offer the highest level of security. Many also enable authentication as an added layer of security in case your master passphrase is ever discovered.
A hacker may have to break through all three layers of security to gain access to your password vault  account: encrypted records, master passphrase, and safety key. Even the most competent hacker may find it difficult, if not impossible, to crack all three.
Finally, they let you create secure credentials by combining lowercase and uppercase, characters and letters. This feature ensures that all of your credentials are unique and difficult to guess.

Final Comments
Get a password manager asap. Using the same password for everything is NGMI. 
If your a single individual and dont want too many features I suggest using “LastPass” to get started.
If your a big enterprise/Business I strongly suggest getting started with something like “BitWarden”.
 
 
Thanks For Reading, Have A Good Day!!!
